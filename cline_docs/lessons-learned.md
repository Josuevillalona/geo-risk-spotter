## Lessons Learned

## 2025-06-13 - GeoJSON File Serving Issues on Vercel

### Description
Encountered issues serving the `ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson` file (approx. 49MB) from the `public` directory of the Vercel deployment. This resulted in a 404 error when the frontend attempted to fetch the file.

### Root Cause
Vercel's handling of larger static files in the `public` directory, potentially in combination with Git LFS, was unreliable for a file of this size in this project configuration.

### Solution
Switched to hosting the `ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson` file on Amazon S3 and configured the S3 bucket for static website hosting. Updated the frontend to fetch the GeoJSON data directly from the public S3 object URL.

### Lessons Learned
Relying solely on Vercel's `public` directory for serving larger static assets may not be reliable. Dedicated static hosting solutions like Amazon S3 are more robust for this purpose.

## 2025-06-13 - CORS Error when Fetching from S3

### Description
After hosting the GeoJSON on S3, the Vercel application encountered a CORS error ("No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present") when trying to fetch the file.

### Root Cause
The S3 bucket's default configuration did not include a CORS policy that allowed requests from the Vercel deployment's origin (`https://geo-risk-spotter.vercel.app`).

### Solution
Added a CORS policy to the S3 bucket permissions allowing GET requests from the Vercel application's origin.

### Lessons Learned
When fetching resources from a different domain (like S3) in a web application, ensure the resource's host is configured with a CORS policy that permits requests from the application's origin.

## 2025-06-13 - Choropleth Map Displaying Only One Color

### Description
After implementing the choropleth map with the calculated RiskScore, the entire map appeared red, indicating all zip codes were falling into the highest risk category.

### Root Cause
The color ranges defined in the `getRiskScoreColor` function in `src/Map.jsx` were designed for a score range of 0-0.6, while the actual calculated RiskScores ranged from 0 to over 30.

### Solution
Analyzed the distribution of the calculated RiskScores using Python script statistics (min, max, mean, quartiles). Updated the `getRiskScoreColor` function with new color ranges and a green-yellow-red scheme that better matched the actual range and distribution of the RiskScores.

### Lessons Learned
Ensure that the data ranges used for visualization (e.g., color scales in a choropleth map) accurately reflect the actual range and distribution of the data being visualized. Use data statistics to inform the design of visualization scales.

## 2025-06-13 - Vercel Build Failure due to Duplicate Imports

### Description
The Vercel build failed with an error indicating that the symbol "Map" had already been declared in `src/App.jsx`.

### Root Cause
A previous `replace_in_file` operation on `src/App.jsx` resulted in duplicate import statements for `React`, `useState`, and `Map`.

### Solution
Modified `src/App.jsx` using `replace_in_file` to remove the duplicate import statements.

### Lessons Learned
When using `replace_in_file`, carefully craft SEARCH blocks to avoid unintentionally duplicating existing code, especially import statements. Always review the `final_file_content` after using file modification tools to catch such errors early.

## 2025-06-13 - Unresolved Food Insecurity Data Discrepancy

### Description
Observed that "Food Insecurity Crude Prevalence" consistently displays as 0% in the frontend sidebar for all clicked zip codes, despite the original CSV containing non-zero values for this metric.

### Status
Unresolved.

### Investigation
- Python script correctly includes and processes the `FOODINSECU_CrudePrev` column and applies `fillna(0)`.
- Sample output from the Python script shows `FOODINSECU_CrudePrev` as 0.0 for sample features.
- Frontend console output of fetched GeoJSON data shows that the `FOODINSECU_CrudePrev` property is missing from the `properties` object received by the frontend.
- Discrepancy exists between Python script's internal state and the data received by the frontend.

### Potential Next Steps
- Further investigate the GeoJSON export process in the Python script to ensure all properties are being written correctly.
- Examine the original CSV data more thoroughly for the specific New York zip codes to confirm if the data is truly missing or zero for this column in that subset.
- Explore potential limitations or behaviors of `geopandas.to_file` or the GeoJSON format itself regarding how properties are handled.

## 2025-06-14 - Troubleshooting Backend Environment Variable Loading

### Description
Encountered issues with the backend not loading the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the `.env` file when running locally using `uvicorn --app-dir .`.

### Root Cause
The `load_dotenv()` function by default looks for `.env` in the current working directory or its parents. When running with `--app-dir .` from the project root, it was not finding the `.env` file located in the `backend/` subdirectory.

### Solution
Modified the `load_dotenv()` call in `backend/main.py` to explicitly specify the path to the `.env` file: `load_dotenv('backend/.env')`.

### Lessons Learned
When using `python-dotenv` and running a Python application from a different working directory than where the `.env` file is located, explicitly provide the path to the `.env` file in the `load_dotenv()` call.

## 2025-06-14 - Troubleshooting Render Backend Deployment

### Description
Encountered multiple issues during backend deployment to Render, including "No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'", "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'", and service shutdown after startup.

### Root Cause
- Missing `requirements.txt` file for dependency installation on Render.
- Incorrect Uvicorn start command expecting `backend` as a top-level module even with "Root Directory" set to `backend/`.
- Potential issues with Uvicorn not correctly picking up the `$PORT` environment variable provided by Render.

### Solution
- Created a `backend/requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies.
- Set Render's "Root Directory" to `backend/`.
- Updated Render's "Build Command" to `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Updated Render's "Start Command" to `env PORT=$PORT uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` to explicitly pass the port.

### Lessons Learned
- Always include a `requirements.txt` file for Python project deployments to ensure dependencies are installed correctly.
- Carefully configure the "Root Directory", "Build Command", and "Start Command" in deployment platforms like Render, ensuring they are compatible with the project structure and how the application is started.
- Explicitly passing environment variables like `$PORT` in the start command using `env` can help ensure they are correctly picked up by the application.

## 2025-06-14 - OpenRouter API Rate Limits

### Description
Encountered 429 Too Many Requests errors from the OpenRouter API when using the `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` model.

### Root Cause
The free tier of the `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` model on OpenRouter has strict rate limits, and these limits were being hit.

### Solution
Switched the AI model used in the backend to `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`, which may have different or less strict rate limits.

### Lessons Learned
Be aware of API rate limits, especially when using free tiers of external services. Have a strategy for handling rate limits (e.g., retries, switching models, upgrading plans).

## 2025-06-14 - Frontend Network Errors and Backend Accessibility

### Description
Initially encountered `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors in the frontend when trying to call the deployed backend on Render.

### Root Cause
This was a client-side network connectivity issue preventing the frontend from reaching the Render URL.

### Solution
Troubleshooted local internet connection and confirmed accessibility of the Render URL directly in the browser.

### Lessons Learned
Network errors in the frontend console when calling a deployed backend often indicate a client-side network issue rather than a problem with the deployed service itself. Always verify network connectivity and try accessing the deployed service URL directly.

## 2025-06-14 - Frontend Component Structure and Data Display

### Description
Refactored the frontend component structure to use a `Dashboard` component and a tabbed `Sidebar` for displaying AI insights and raw data. Initially had confusion regarding where raw data was being displayed (sidebar vs. popover).

### Root Cause
The frontend structure evolved with the introduction of new components and a tabbed interface in the sidebar, changing how raw data and AI insights are presented compared to earlier iterations. The `DataPopover` component, initially intended for raw data on the map, became redundant with the tabbed sidebar.

### Solution
- Updated `src/App.jsx` to render the `Dashboard` component and pass state down.
- Updated `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` to render the `Map` and the top-level `src/Sidebar.jsx`.
- Updated the top-level `src/Sidebar.jsx` to implement the tabbed interface and render raw data as a table.
- Modified `src/Map.jsx` to remove `DataPopover` control logic and `layer.bindPopup`.
- Removed the `src/DataPopover.jsx` component.

### Lessons Learned
Maintain clear documentation of the frontend component structure and data flow as the project evolves to avoid confusion. Regularly review and refactor components to ensure a clear separation of concerns and avoid redundant functionality.

## 2025-06-14 - Browser Tool Failure

### Description
Encountered a persistent error ("Protocol error (Page.captureScreenshot): Not attached to an active page") when attempting to use the `browser_action` tool to launch the application in a browser.

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is currently unknown. It appears to be an environment-specific problem with the browser tool.

### Solution
Unable to resolve the issue with the browser tool. Proceeded with the task based on code analysis and updated documentation to reflect the completed task and the tool failure.

### Lessons Learned
Be aware that tool failures can occur. When a tool is consistently failing and preventing verification, proceed with the task based on available information (e.g., code analysis) and document the tool failure.

## 2025-06-18 - Render Deployment Failure due to Git LFS Budget

### Description
Encountered repeated deployment failures on Render with an "exceeded LFS budget" error when cloning the repository. The error logs indicated that Render was attempting to download large GeoJSON files tracked by Git LFS from the repository history.

### Root Cause
Multiple large GeoJSON files (`dist/ny_new_york_zip_codes_health_data.geojson`, `dist/shapes.geojson`, and `public/ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson`) were present in the repository's history and tracked by Git LFS. The cumulative size of these files exceeded the available Git LFS budget on the GitHub account, preventing Render from successfully cloning the repository during the backend build process.

### Solution
Used `git-filter-repo` to rewrite the repository's history and remove the large GeoJSON files from Git LFS tracking and history. This involved running `git-filter-repo` for each file, followed by `git lfs prune` to clean up local LFS objects, re-adding the 'origin' remote (as `git-filter-repo` removes it), and force pushing the rewritten history to the remote repository. Clearing the build cache on Render was also necessary to ensure a fresh clone of the updated history.

### Lessons Learned
- Large files tracked by Git LFS can quickly consume the available budget and cause issues with cloning and deployment on platforms that require accessing the full repository history.
- Removing unnecessary large files from repository history using tools like `git-filter-repo` is crucial for managing repository size and LFS usage.
- Rewriting Git history is a powerful operation that requires caution and understanding of its implications (e.g., force pushing, impacting collaborators).
- Deployment platforms may cache repository contents, and clearing the cache might be necessary after a history rewrite to ensure the platform uses the updated history.

## 2025-06-20 - Save & Persist Feature: Hybrid State Management Approach

### Description
Implemented a "Save Analysis" feature for diabetes risk analyses using Zustand store with localStorage persistence. Chose a hybrid approach (existing props + Zustand for new features) over full state migration.

### Challenge
Initial attempt to migrate Sidebar.jsx to use Zustand directly broke zip code selection functionality because the rest of the app still used local state and prop-drilling.

### Root Cause
**State Source Disconnect**: When only one component (Sidebar) reads from Zustand but other components (App, Map) still update local state, the two state systems become disconnected. Clicking a zip code updated local state, but Sidebar was reading from Zustand store (which wasn't being updated).

### Solution
**Hybrid Approach**: 
1. Keep existing prop-drilling architecture unchanged (zero regression risk)
2. Add Zustand store ONLY for new save/persist functionality
3. Pass current props to store for saving (bridge between the two systems)
4. Use Zustand selectors only for saved analyses management

### Key Implementation
```javascript
// In Sidebar.jsx - bridge between props and store
const handleSave = () => {
  saveCurrentAnalysis({
    selectedArea,    // from props
    aiSummary,      // from props  
    chatHistory: [] // default
  });
};
```

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Partial State Migration Risk
**Never migrate only some components to a new state system while others remain on the old system.** This creates state synchronization issues and broken data flow.

#### 2. Hybrid Approach Benefits
- **Zero regression risk** - existing functionality unchanged
- **Immediate value delivery** - new features work without touching existing code
- **Future migration path** - store architecture ready for full migration later
- **Reduced complexity** - smaller surface area for bugs

#### 3. Testing Strategy for State Changes
Always test the complete user workflow after state management changes:
1. Select zip code → AI analysis → Save → View saved → Delete
2. Browser refresh to test persistence
3. Edge cases (no selection, rapid operations, storage limits)

#### 4. Error Handling for Storage Operations
localStorage operations can fail due to:
- Storage quota exceeded
- Private browsing mode restrictions  
- Browser security policies
- Storage corruption

Always wrap in try/catch with user-friendly error messages.

#### 5. Gradual Feature Rollout
Start with minimal viable functionality (save/load) before adding complex features (search, export, etc.). This allows for user feedback and validation before investing in advanced features.

### Code Quality Patterns That Worked
1. **Parameter-based store actions** - `saveCurrentAnalysis(data)` accepts data instead of reading from store
2. **Targeted Zustand selectors** - Only subscribe to specific store slices
3. **Status feedback patterns** - Immediate user feedback with auto-clearing timeouts
4. **Versioned data structures** - Include version field for future migrations
5. **Storage quota checking** - Proactive limit checking before operations

### Recommendation
For future state management changes, prefer gradual hybrid approaches over "big bang" migrations, especially in production applications with complex state dependencies.

## 2025-07-01 - Systematic Component Refactoring Success

### Description
Successfully completed Phase 1 of systematic component refactoring following the same MVP-first methodology used throughout the project. Extracted 4 focused components from complex, multi-responsibility files, achieving significant complexity reduction while maintaining zero regressions.

### Refactoring Strategy Applied
1. **MapPopup Extraction** (completed previously): 169-line popup logic → dedicated component
2. **MarkdownComponents Extraction**: 80+ lines of styling → reusable presentation layer
3. **RelevanceBar Extraction**: Progress bar visualization → common component library
4. **ChatMessage Extraction**: Message rendering logic → focused UI component

### Key Technical Achievements
- **40% code reduction** in Chatbot.jsx (444 → 265 lines)
- **Reusable component library** established (`common/`, `chat/` directories)
- **Zero regression deployment** - all functionality preserved
- **Enhanced testability** through component isolation
- **Consistent architectural patterns** applied across all extractions

### Implementation Lessons
1. **MVP-First Refactoring Works**: Same incremental approach scales from features to technical debt
2. **Component Boundaries**: Look for styling logic, rendering patterns, and reusable UI elements
3. **Directory Organization**: Logical grouping (`chat/`, `common/`) improves discoverability
4. **Import Path Cleanliness**: Clear dependency structure makes components more maintainable
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Extract without breaking existing interfaces

### Code Quality Improvements

2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes during refactoring
3. **Test Continuously**: Verify functionality after each extraction
4. **Document Progress**: Track benefits and lessons learned
5. **Build Foundation**: Create reusable components for future features

This systematic approach to component refactoring mirrors the project's overall success with feature development, proving that MVP methodology scales across all aspects of software development.

## 2025-07-01 - Codebase Refactoring Success

### Description
Completed comprehensive refactoring of both frontend and backend code to improve maintainability, modularity, and adherence to project standards. Successfully extracted complex logic from large components and services.

### Key Refactoring Actions
- **Frontend**: Extracted complex logic from `Map.jsx`, `Chatbot.jsx`, `EnhancedInterventionDisplay.jsx`, and `Sidebar.jsx` into focused, reusable components
- **Style Migration**: Converted all inline styles to Tailwind CSS and moved animations to global CSS
- **Backend**: Separated prompt and cache management into dedicated service modules
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed broken and redundant code while preserving all functionality

### Technical Success Patterns
1. **Incremental Approach**: Refactored one component at a time, testing each change
2. **Service Extraction**: Created clear service boundaries with well-defined interfaces
3. **Tailwind Migration**: Systematically replaced inline styles with utility classes
4. **Documentation**: Updated progress logs and lessons learned throughout the process

- **Performance**: Removed redundant code and optimized component structure
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner codebase following consistent standards
- **Zero Regressions**: All existing functionality preserved during refactoring

### Lessons Learned
- **Component Size Matters**: Large components (>200 lines) become hard to maintain and should be broken down
- **Style Consistency**: Inline styles and style blocks make maintenance difficult; Tailwind CSS provides better consistency
- **Service Separation**: Backend logic should be separated into focused service modules for better testability
- **Documentation**: Keeping documentation updated during refactoring helps track progress and impact
- **Testing Throughout**: Testing after each refactoring step prevents accumulation of issues

## 2025-07-01 - Sprint 2: Section-Based Navigation Refactor

### Description
Successfully completed Sprint 2 by refactoring the sidebar from a 5-tab navigation system to a simplified 3-section approach (Analysis, Recommendations, Saved). This major UX improvement required careful component restructuring and CSS updates.

### Implementation Strategy
Used a complete component refactor approach rather than incremental changes to ensure a clean, maintainable codebase. Leveraged existing CSS infrastructure from earlier conversation summary while adding new section-specific styles.

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Section-Based Architecture**: Organized features by user workflow rather than technical functionality
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Implemented collapsible raw data section to reduce cognitive load
3. **Enhanced RAG Toggle**: Added toggle functionality to switch between standard chat and advanced recommendations
4. **Component Consolidation**: Grouped related functionality (AI Summary + metrics + raw data) in Analysis section

### Lessons Learned
- **User Workflow Focus**: Organizing UI by user workflow (analyze → recommend → save) is more intuitive than technical categorization
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features should be accessible but not overwhelming to new users
- **CSS Infrastructure**: Having well-structured CSS classes from previous iterations made the refactor much smoother
- **Component Modularity**: Previous refactoring work (SaveAnalysisButton, SavedAnalysesList) made integration seamless
- **Zero Regression Goal**: Maintaining all existing functionality while improving UX is achievable with careful planning

### Success Factors
- **Existing Component Library**: Reused existing components (RecommendationsTab, EnhancedInterventionDisplay)
- **CSS Foundation**: Leveraged existing section navigation CSS that was already prepared
- **Clear Information Architecture**: Three logical sections aligned with user mental models
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained mobile-friendly design throughout refactor

### Future Applications
- Section-based navigation is more scalable than tab-based for complex applications
- Progressive disclosure patterns can be applied to other areas of the application
- Toggle components provide elegant ways to switch between feature sets
- Health metrics grid pattern can be reused for other dashboard views

## 2025-07-02 - Map Legend Sizing Issues

### Description
The Risk Indicator legend was covering most of the map area, making it difficult for users to interact with the geographic data.

### Root Cause
The `.context-map-legend` CSS class lacked proper size constraints, allowing the legend to expand without limits.

### Solution
Added comprehensive size constraints with max-width, min-width, and responsive design.

### Lessons Learned
Always constrain absolutely positioned elements with explicit width/height limits and test legend sizing with actual content.

## 2025-07-02 - Scrolling Issues in AI Insights Hub

### Description
Users reported inability to scroll in certain sections of the AI Insights hub, particularly in the dual-panel layout where content would be cut off and inaccessible.

### Root Cause
The SideBySideDashboard component was using CSS classes that were not defined in the App.css file, causing the layout to have incorrect height and overflow properties. The main issues were:
1. Missing CSS for `.dashboard-side-by-side`, `.main-content-container`, and `.ai-insights-panel`
2. Incorrect flexbox hierarchy without proper `min-height: 0` on flex containers
3. Missing `overflow-y: auto` on the `.section-container` and `.insights-panel-content`

### Solution
Added comprehensive CSS for the SideBySideDashboard component including:
- Proper flexbox layout with `height: 100vh` and `overflow: hidden` on main container
- `flex: 1` and `min-height: 0` on flex children to enable proper scrolling
- `overflow-y: auto` on content areas that need scrolling
- Proper `.sidebar-wrapper` and `.section-container` styles for the sidebar content

### Lessons Learned
- Always ensure CSS classes used in components have corresponding styles defined
- For flexbox layouts with scrolling, use `min-height: 0` on flex containers and `overflow-y: auto` on scrollable content
- Test scrolling behavior thoroughly, especially in complex nested layouts
- Consider using CSS Grid or flexbox debugging tools to visualize layout issues

### Code Changes
```css
.dashboard-side-by-side {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.insights-panel-content {
  flex: 1;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  min-height: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.section-container {
  flex: 1;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  min-height: 0;
  padding-top: 8px;
}
```
