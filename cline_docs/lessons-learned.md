## 2025-06-13 - GeoJSON File Serving Issues on Vercel

### Description
Encountered issues serving the `ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson` file (approx. 49MB) from the `public` directory of the Vercel deployment. This resulted in a 404 error when the frontend attempted to fetch the file.

### Root Cause
Vercel's handling of larger static files in the `public` directory, potentially in combination with Git LFS, was unreliable for a file of this size in this project configuration.

### Solution
Switched to hosting the `ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson` file on Amazon S3 and configured the S3 bucket for static website hosting. Updated the frontend to fetch the GeoJSON data directly from the public S3 object URL.

### Lessons Learned
Relying solely on Vercel's `public` directory for serving larger static assets may not be reliable. Dedicated static hosting solutions like Amazon S3 are more robust for this purpose.

## 2025-06-13 - CORS Error when Fetching from S3

### Description
After hosting the GeoJSON on S3, the Vercel application encountered a CORS error ("No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present") when trying to fetch the file.

### Root Cause
The S3 bucket's default configuration did not include a CORS policy that allowed requests from the Vercel deployment's origin (`https://geo-risk-spotter.vercel.app`).

### Solution
Added a CORS policy to the S3 bucket permissions allowing GET requests from the Vercel application's origin.

### Lessons Learned
When fetching resources from a different domain (like S3) in a web application, ensure the resource's host is configured with a CORS policy that permits requests from the application's origin.

## 2025-06-13 - Choropleth Map Displaying Only One Color

### Description
After implementing the choropleth map with the calculated RiskScore, the entire map appeared red, indicating all zip codes were falling into the highest risk category.

### Root Cause
The color ranges defined in the `getRiskScoreColor` function in `src/Map.jsx` were designed for a score range of 0-0.6, while the actual calculated RiskScores ranged from 0 to over 30.

### Solution
Analyzed the distribution of the calculated RiskScores using Python script statistics (min, max, mean, quartiles). Updated the `getRiskScoreColor` function with new color ranges and a green-yellow-red scheme that better matched the actual range and distribution of the RiskScores.

### Lessons Learned
Ensure that the data ranges used for visualization (e.g., color scales in a choropleth map) accurately reflect the actual range and distribution of the data being visualized. Use data statistics to inform the design of visualization scales.

## 2025-06-13 - Vercel Build Failure due to Duplicate Imports

### Description
The Vercel build failed with an error indicating that the symbol "Map" had already been declared in `src/App.jsx`.

### Root Cause
A previous `replace_in_file` operation on `src/App.jsx` resulted in duplicate import statements for `React`, `useState`, and `Map`.

### Solution
Modified `src/App.jsx` using `replace_in_file` to remove the duplicate import statements.

### Lessons Learned
When using `replace_in_file`, carefully craft SEARCH blocks to avoid unintentionally duplicating existing code, especially import statements. Always review the `final_file_content` after using file modification tools to catch such errors early.

## 2025-06-13 - Unresolved Food Insecurity Data Discrepancy

### Description
Observed that "Food Insecurity Crude Prevalence" consistently displays as 0% in the frontend sidebar for all clicked zip codes, despite the original CSV containing non-zero values for this metric.

### Status
Unresolved.

### Investigation
- Python script correctly includes and processes the `FOODINSECU_CrudePrev` column and applies `fillna(0)`.
- Sample output from the Python script shows `FOODINSECU_CrudePrev` as 0.0 for sample features.
- Frontend console output of fetched GeoJSON data shows that the `FOODINSECU_CrudePrev` property is missing from the `properties` object received by the frontend.
- Discrepancy exists between Python script's internal state and the data received by the frontend.

### Potential Next Steps
- Further investigate the GeoJSON export process in the Python script to ensure all properties are being written correctly.
- Examine the original CSV data more thoroughly for the specific New York zip codes to confirm if the data is truly missing or zero for this column in that subset.
- Explore potential limitations or behaviors of `geopandas.to_file` or the GeoJSON format itself regarding how properties are handled.

## 2025-06-14 - Troubleshooting Backend Environment Variable Loading

### Description
Encountered issues with the backend not loading the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the `.env` file when running locally using `uvicorn --app-dir .`.

### Root Cause
The `load_dotenv()` function by default looks for `.env` in the current working directory or its parents. When running with `--app-dir .` from the project root, it was not finding the `.env` file located in the `backend/` subdirectory.

### Solution
Modified the `load_dotenv()` call in `backend/main.py` to explicitly specify the path to the `.env` file: `load_dotenv('backend/.env')`.

### Lessons Learned
When using `python-dotenv` and running a Python application from a different working directory than where the `.env` file is located, explicitly provide the path to the `.env` file in the `load_dotenv()` call.

## 2025-06-14 - Troubleshooting Render Backend Deployment

### Description
Encountered multiple issues during backend deployment to Render, including "No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'", "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'", and service shutdown after startup.

### Root Cause
- Missing `requirements.txt` file for dependency installation on Render.
- Incorrect Uvicorn start command expecting `backend` as a top-level module even with "Root Directory" set to `backend/`.
- Potential issues with Uvicorn not correctly picking up the `$PORT` environment variable provided by Render.

### Solution
- Created a `backend/requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies.
- Set Render's "Root Directory" to `backend/`.
- Updated Render's "Build Command" to `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Updated Render's "Start Command" to `env PORT=$PORT uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` to explicitly pass the port.

### Lessons Learned
- Always include a `requirements.txt` file for Python project deployments to ensure dependencies are installed correctly.
- Carefully configure the "Root Directory", "Build Command", and "Start Command" in deployment platforms like Render, ensuring they are compatible with the project structure and how the application is started.
- Explicitly passing environment variables like `$PORT` in the start command using `env` can help ensure they are correctly picked up by the application.

## 2025-06-14 - OpenRouter API Rate Limits

### Description
Encountered 429 Too Many Requests errors from the OpenRouter API when using the `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` model.

### Root Cause
The free tier of the `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` model on OpenRouter has strict rate limits, and these limits were being hit.

### Solution
Switched the AI model used in the backend to `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`, which may have different or less strict rate limits.

### Lessons Learned
Be aware of API rate limits, especially when using free tiers of external services. Have a strategy for handling rate limits (e.g., retries, switching models, upgrading plans).

## 2025-06-14 - Frontend Network Errors and Backend Accessibility

### Description
Initially encountered `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors in the frontend when trying to call the deployed backend on Render.

### Root Cause
This was a client-side network connectivity issue preventing the frontend from reaching the Render URL.

### Solution
Troubleshooted local internet connection and confirmed accessibility of the Render URL directly in the browser.

### Lessons Learned
Network errors in the frontend console when calling a deployed backend often indicate a client-side network issue rather than a problem with the deployed service itself. Always verify network connectivity and try accessing the deployed service URL directly.

## 2025-06-14 - Frontend Component Structure and Data Display

### Description
Refactored the frontend component structure to use a `Dashboard` component and a tabbed `Sidebar` for displaying AI insights and raw data. Initially had confusion regarding where raw data was being displayed (sidebar vs. popover).

### Root Cause
The frontend structure evolved with the introduction of new components and a tabbed interface in the sidebar, changing how raw data and AI insights are presented compared to earlier iterations. The `DataPopover` component, initially intended for raw data on the map, became redundant with the tabbed sidebar.

### Solution
- Updated `src/App.jsx` to render the `Dashboard` component and pass state down.
- Updated `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` to render the `Map` and the top-level `src/Sidebar.jsx`.
- Updated the top-level `src/Sidebar.jsx` to implement the tabbed interface and render raw data as a table.
- Modified `src/Map.jsx` to remove `DataPopover` control logic and `layer.bindPopup`.
- Removed the `src/DataPopover.jsx` component.

### Lessons Learned
Maintain clear documentation of the frontend component structure and data flow as the project evolves to avoid confusion. Regularly review and refactor components to ensure a clear separation of concerns and avoid redundant functionality.

## 2025-06-14 - Browser Tool Failure

### Description
Encountered a persistent error ("Protocol error (Page.captureScreenshot): Not attached to an active page") when attempting to use the `browser_action` tool to launch the application in a browser.

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is currently unknown. It appears to be an environment-specific problem with the browser tool.

### Solution
Unable to resolve the issue with the browser tool. Proceeded with the task based on code analysis and updated documentation to reflect the completed task and the tool failure.

### Lessons Learned
Be aware that tool failures can occur. When a tool is consistently failing and preventing verification, proceed with the task based on available information (e.g., code analysis) and document the tool failure.

## 2025-06-18 - Render Deployment Failure due to Git LFS Budget

### Description
Encountered repeated deployment failures on Render with an "exceeded LFS budget" error when cloning the repository. The error logs indicated that Render was attempting to download large GeoJSON files tracked by Git LFS from the repository history.

### Root Cause
Multiple large GeoJSON files (`dist/ny_new_york_zip_codes_health_data.geojson`, `dist/shapes.geojson`, and `public/ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson`) were present in the repository's history and tracked by Git LFS. The cumulative size of these files exceeded the available Git LFS budget on the GitHub account, preventing Render from successfully cloning the repository during the backend build process.

### Solution
Used `git-filter-repo` to rewrite the repository's history and remove the large GeoJSON files from Git LFS tracking and history. This involved running `git-filter-repo` for each file, followed by `git lfs prune` to clean up local LFS objects, re-adding the 'origin' remote (as `git-filter-repo` removes it), and force pushing the rewritten history to the remote repository. Clearing the build cache on Render was also necessary to ensure a fresh clone of the updated history.

### Lessons Learned
- Large files tracked by Git LFS can quickly consume the available budget and cause issues with cloning and deployment on platforms that require accessing the full repository history.
- Removing unnecessary large files from repository history using tools like `git-filter-repo` is crucial for managing repository size and LFS usage.
- Rewriting Git history is a powerful operation that requires caution and understanding of its implications (e.g., force pushing, impacting collaborators).
- Deployment platforms may cache repository contents, and clearing the cache might be necessary after a history rewrite to ensure the platform uses the updated history.

## 2025-07-01 - Systematic Component Refactoring Success

### Description
Successfully completed Phase 1 of systematic component refactoring following the same MVP-first methodology used throughout the project. Extracted 4 focused components from complex, multi-responsibility files, achieving significant complexity reduction while maintaining zero regressions.
