# Current Task: Contextualized Intervention Recommendations (Feature 1) - IN PROGRESS 🚧

## Phase 2 - Sprint 2.2: Evidence-Based Intervention Recommendations

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Enhance the existing chatbot with evidence-based intervention recommendations by integrating a knowledge base of proven public health interventions, providing users with actionable solutions alongside data analysis.

### 📋 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
**Approach**: Incremental enhancement using proven S3 + chatbot patterns  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk Level**: LOW (builds on existing, stable infrastructure)

### 🔧 TECHNICAL APPROACH
- **Knowledge Base**: JSON file hosted on existing S3 infrastructure
- **Retrieval**: Keyword-based matching (no vector DB initially) 
- **Integration**: Enhance existing `/api/chat` endpoint
- **Frontend**: Add single quick action button to existing chatbot
- **Caching**: Server-side intervention caching for performance

### 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Zero regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Intervention button provides relevant, helpful recommendations  
- [ ] Production deployment successful and stable
- [ ] Performance impact < 400ms additional response time
- [ ] Error handling graceful in all failure scenarios
- [ ] User feedback positive on intervention relevance

### 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

#### Week 1: Foundation & Risk Mitigation
- [x] Create 10-intervention JSON knowledge base
- [ ] Upload to S3 with CORS configuration  
- [x] Implement backend intervention fetching with caching
- [x] Add keyword-based matching logic
- [x] Enhance `/api/chat` endpoint safely
- [x] Add intervention quick action button
- [ ] Complete local testing

#### Week 2: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel  
- [ ] Test production S3 access
- [ ] Performance and error handling validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing

#### Week 3: Enhancement & Polish
- [ ] Expand to 25 interventions
- [ ] Optimize keyword matching
- [ ] UI polish and documentation
- [ ] Feature flag implementation

### 🛡️ RISK MITIGATION
- **S3 CORS**: Use existing proven S3 configuration pattern
- **Performance**: Server-side caching + smart intervention limiting  
- **Token Costs**: Limit to 3 interventions per response
- **Rollback**: Feature flag for immediate disable if needed

## Previous Task: Save & Persist Feature - COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED OBJECTIVES
Successfully implemented a comprehensive "Save Analysis" feature that allows users to:
- Save diabetes risk analyses to localStorage
- View all saved analyses in a dedicated tab
- Delete saved analyses with confirmation
- Persist data across browser sessions

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
#### Core Features Delivered
1. **Zustand Store with Persistence** - Global state management with localStorage
2. **Save Analysis UI** - Button with real-time feedback in sidebar
3. **View Saved Analyses** - Dedicated "Saved" tab with analysis history
4. **Delete Functionality** - Remove unwanted analyses with confirmation
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
6. **Storage Management** - Quota checking and data integrity validation

#### Technical Approach
- **Hybrid Strategy**: Preserved existing prop-drilling, added Zustand only for new features
- **Zero Regressions**: All existing functionality (map, AI analysis) unchanged
- **Future-Ready**: Store architecture prepared for full migration if needed

#### Files Modified
- `src/store.js` - New Zustand store with persistence (NEW FILE)
- `src/Sidebar.jsx` - Enhanced with save/delete UI and "Saved" tab

#### Key Achievements
✅ **Risk-Free Implementation** - No breaking changes to existing functionality  
✅ **Production Ready** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback  
✅ **Persistent Storage** - Data survives browser refresh and sessions  
✅ **Intuitive UX** - Clear visual feedback for all operations  
✅ **Scalable Architecture** - Versioned data with migration support  

### 📊 SUCCESS METRICS
- **Zero regressions** in existing zip code selection and AI analysis
- **100% data persistence** across browser sessions  
- **Comprehensive testing** completed for all user workflows
- **Full documentation** in progress-log.md and lessons-learned.md

### 🚀 NEXT OPPORTUNITIES
1. **Load Analysis Feature** - Click saved analysis to restore to main view
2. **Search/Filter** - Find analyses by zip code or date  
3. **Export/Import** - JSON export for data portability
4. **Full Zustand Migration** - Eliminate remaining prop-drilling (optional)
