- **Expected Health Properties**: `RiskScore`, `DIABETES_CrudePrev`, `OBESITY_CrudePrev`, etc.
- **File Purpose**: Local file contains basic geography; S3 file should contain health metrics

### 🚨 Issue Resolution
- ✅ **Zip Code Search**: Now correctly finds zip codes like 11421, 11104 using `ZCTA5CE10`
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing health data without crashes
- ✅ **Clear Messaging**: Users understand when health analysis is unavailable
- ✅ **Robust Property Handling**: Works with multiple zip code property naming conventions

### 📝 Code Changes Summary
```jsx
// ENHANCED: Property mapping with ZCTA5CE10 support
const feature = data.features?.find(f => 
  f.properties?.zip_code === zipCode || 
  f.properties?.ZIP_CODE === zipCode ||
  f.properties?.zipcode === zipCode ||
  f.properties?.ZCTA5CE10 === zipCode  // Main property in NY data
);

// NEW: Health data validation
const hasHealthData = feature.properties.RiskScore !== undefined || 
                     feature.properties.DIABETES_CrudePrev !== undefined;
```

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Upload complete health dataset to S3 with proper health metrics
- Test with production data source containing full health information
- Verify CORS configuration for seamless S3 access

## Data Source URL Synchronization Fix - COMPLETED ✅ (July 7, 2025)

### 🎯 Overview
Fixed critical inconsistency where the Map component and TopBar search were using different S3 URLs, causing the search to fail to find health data while map clicks worked correctly. Synchronized both components to use the same data source URL.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **URL Synchronization**: Updated TopBar.jsx to use the same S3 URL as Map.jsx (`geo-risk-spotspot-geojson`)
- **Enhanced Health Data Detection**: Improved health data validation to check multiple health properties
- **Better Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track health data availability and AI analysis payloads
- **Flexible Property Handling**: Enhanced zip code property mapping for consistency

### 🚨 Root Cause Analysis
- **Map Component**: Used `https://geo-risk-spotspot-geojson.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/` (double "spot")
- **TopBar Component**: Used `https://geo-risk-spotter-geojson.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/` (single "spot")
- **Result**: Search fallback to local file with only geographic data, while map had full health data

### 📊 User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **Consistent Data Source**: Both search and map clicks now use the same dataset
- ✅ **Accurate Health Data Detection**: Properly identifies when health metrics are available
- ✅ **Better Error Diagnosis**: Enhanced logging helps identify data availability issues
- ✅ **Unified User Experience**: Search and map interactions behave consistently

### 📝 Code Changes Summary
```jsx
// FIXED: URL synchronization between components
// TopBar now uses same URL as Map component
response = await axios.get('https://geo-risk-spotspot-geojson.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ny_new_york_zip_codes_health.geojson', {
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
});

// ENHANCED: Health data validation
const hasHealthData = feature.properties.RiskScore !== undefined || 
                     feature.properties.DIABETES_CrudePrev !== undefined ||
                     feature.properties.OBESITY_CrudePrev !== undefined ||
