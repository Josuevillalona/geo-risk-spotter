# React Frontend Coding Standards

- Use **functional components** with hooks for state and side effects.
- Use **Zustand** for global state; keep component state local when possible.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling; follow consistent class naming.
- Use **Axios** for API requests; handle errors gracefully.
- Organize components into logical directories by functionality.
- Keep components small, focused, and easy to maintain.
- Ensure all data visualizations are accessible and interpretable.
