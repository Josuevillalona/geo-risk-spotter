# RiskPulse: Diabetes - GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
RiskPulse: Diabetes empowers public health professionals and policymakers to identify and explore diabetes risk hotspots across communities. Leveraging interactive geospatial mapping and AI-driven data insights, the platform transforms complex health data into actionable intelligence for targeted interventions and informed decision-making.

## Core Development Principles

### Code Quality Standards
- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming conventions, formatting, and architectural patterns
- **Modularity**: Break code into small, reusable components or modules
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear and concise documentation for all components

### Project Requirements
- Prioritize accessibility and interpretability in all data visualizations
- Ensure code is scalable and maintainable for national-scale datasets
- Use cost-effective solutions and keep the codebase simple (MVP-first approach)
- Follow structured development workflow with proper testing at each stage

### Tech Stack Preferences
- **Frontend**: React (functional components with hooks), Zustand for state management, Axios for API calls, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geospatial data
- **Development**: Structured planning with clear task breakdown and testing

## Development Workflow

### Planning Phase
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, testable units with clear success criteria
- Reference project roadmap and current task documentation
- Identify dependencies and potential blockers upfront

### Execution Phase
- Work on one task at a time
- Test immediately after implementing each feature
- Follow modular design principles with clear separation of concerns
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### Validation Phase
- Verify functionality against success criteria before proceeding
- Run comprehensive tests including edge cases
- Validate accessibility and user experience requirements

### Documentation Phase
- Update relevant documentation files after significant progress
- Maintain project structure and component relationships
- Document lessons learned and reusable patterns

## Code Generation Guidelines

### General Coding Standards
- Use meaningful variable names that clearly describe their purpose
- Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Follow security best practices for user input validation
- Include appropriate commenting for complex logic
- Maintain consistent formatting following project conventions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Inconsistent code style or naming conventions
- Neglecting error handling or proper documentation
- Creating overly complex components or queries
- Scope creep or adding unnecessary features
- Skipping testing phases during development

## Communication and Task Management
- Always inform when completing tasks and ask for validation before proceeding
- Provide clear progress updates and next steps
- Ask specific clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- State confidence level and reasoning for complex solutions
- Clearly communicate any obstacles preventing progress

## Quality Assurance
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Follow modular design principles with clear separation of concerns
- Include appropriate commenting for complex logic
- Maintain consistent formatting following project conventions
- Consider security best practices for user input validation and data handling
