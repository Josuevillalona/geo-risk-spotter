# RiskPulse: Diabetes

RiskPulse: Diabetes empowers public health professionals and policymakers to identify and explore diabetes risk hotspots across communities. Leveraging interactive geospatial mapping and AI-driven data insights, the platform transforms complex health data into actionable intelligence for targeted interventions and informed decision-making.

## General Coding Principles
- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming conventions, formatting, and architectural patterns.
- **Modularity**: Break code into small, reusable components or modules.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear and concise documentation for project context, tasks, progress, and lessons learned.

## Project Requirements
- Prioritize accessibility and interpretability in all data visualizations.
- Ensure code is scalable and maintainable for national-scale datasets.
- Use cost-effective solutions and keep the codebase simple (MVP-first approach).
- Regularly update project documentation files as the project evolves.

## Tech Stack Preferences
- **Frontend**: React (functional components with hooks), Zustand for state, Axios for API, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Inconsistent code style or naming.
- Neglecting error handling or documentation.
- Overly complex components or queries.
- Scope creep or unnecessary features.
