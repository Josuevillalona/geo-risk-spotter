description: 'Scaffold a new React component'
---
You are to generate a new React functional component using the project's conventions.

Ask for:
- The component name
- The component's purpose and any required props

Requirements:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use Zustand for global state if needed, otherwise keep state local
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Axios for API calls if needed
- Organize the component in the appropriate directory

Apply guidelines from [React Frontend Coding Standards](../instructions/react-frontend.instructions.md).
