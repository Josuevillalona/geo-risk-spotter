Break down the requested feature into a detailed implementation plan.

Requirements:
- Use an iterative, layered approach
- Define clear, objective success criteria for each task
- Organize tasks as vertical slices (touching frontend, backend, and database as needed)
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites

Apply guidelines from [Planning Standards Guidelines](../../.clinerules/02-planning-standards.md).
