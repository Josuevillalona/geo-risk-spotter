## Testing Strategy Guidelines

This document outlines project-specific testing standards for the Geospatial Risk Hotspot project, adhering to the Cline AI Development Framework principles.

### General Principles
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical components and user flows.
- **Automated Testing**: Automate as many tests as possible to ensure consistent and reliable results.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to catch errors early.

### Testing Levels
- **Unit Tests**:
  - **Scope**: Test individual components and functions in isolation.
  - **Focus**: Verify that each unit of code behaves as expected.
  - **Tools**: Jest (Frontend), pytest (Backend).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - **Scope**: Test the interaction between different components and systems.
  - **Focus**: Verify that the frontend and backend work together correctly.
  - **Tools**: Cypress (Frontend), httpx (Backend).
- **End-to-End Tests**:
  - **Scope**: Test the entire application from the user's perspective.
  - **Focus**: Verify that the application meets the user's requirements.
  - **Tools**: Cypress.

### Test Scenarios
- **Frontend**:
  - **Map Rendering**: Verify that the map is rendered correctly and that the data is displayed accurately.
  - **User Interactions**: Verify that user interactions (e.g., clicking on a zip code) trigger the correct events.
  - **AI Integration**: Verify that the frontend can communicate with the backend and display the AI-generated summaries.
- **Backend**:
  - **API Endpoints**: Verify that the API endpoints return the correct data and that they handle errors gracefully.
  - **Database Interactions**: Verify that the backend can interact with the database and that the data is stored correctly.
  - **AI Integration**: Verify that the backend can communicate with the AI layer and that it can generate the correct summaries.
- **Database**:
  - **Schema Validation**: Verify that the database schema is correct.
  - **Data Integrity**: Verify that the data is consistent and accurate.
  - **Performance**: Verify that the database queries are efficient.

### Example (React Unit Test)
```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import MapComponent from '../components/MapComponent';
import { useStore } from '../store';

jest.mock('../store');

describe('MapComponent', () => {
  it('renders the map', () => {
    useStore.mockReturnValue({ apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000' });
    render(<MapComponent />);
    const mapElement = screen.getByTestId('map');
    expect(mapElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Insufficient Test Coverage**: Failing to test all critical components and user flows.
- **Flaky Tests**: Creating tests that are unreliable and that sometimes pass and sometimes fail.
- **Ignoring Test Failures**: Ignoring test failures and not fixing them promptly.

### Actionable Guidelines for Cline
- Write comprehensive tests for all critical components and user flows.
- Automate as many tests as possible.
- Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Fix test failures promptly.
