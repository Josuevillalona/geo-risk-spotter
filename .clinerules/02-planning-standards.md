## Planning Standards Guidelines

This document outlines project-specific planning standards for the Geospatial Risk Hotspot project, adhering to the Cline AI Development Framework principles.

### Task Breakdown Approach
- **Iterative and Layered**: Break down tasks into small, testable units that build upon each other. Each layer should validate a specific part of the system (e.g., map rendering, data loading, AI integration).
- **Slices, Not Layers**: Each sprint should deliver a vertical slice of functionality, not horizontal layers. This means each sprint should touch the frontend, backend, and database (if applicable) to deliver a complete user story.
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Define objective success criteria for each task. This ensures that the task is clearly defined and can be objectively verified.

### Example Task Breakdown (Phase 1 - Sprint 1.1)
- **Task**: Initialize a new React project using Vite.
  - **Success Criteria**: A new React project is created with the specified dependencies and can be run locally.
- **Task**: Set up a new GitHub repository and push your initial code.
  - **Success Criteria**: The React project is pushed to a new GitHub repository.
- **Task**: Connect the repository to Vercel for continuous deployment.
  - **Success Criteria**: The GitHub repository is connected to Vercel, and a live, public Vercel URL is generated.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Overly Complex Tasks**: Breaking down tasks into units that are too large or complex.
- **Unclear Success Criteria**: Failing to define objective success criteria for each task.
- **Neglecting Dependencies**: Failing to identify and address dependencies between tasks.

### Actionable Guidelines for Cline
- Break down tasks into small, testable units with clear success criteria.
- Prioritize tasks based on the project's core goals and requirements.
- Regularly review and update the task breakdown as the project evolves.
- Follow the "Slices, Not Layers" approach to ensure each sprint delivers a complete user story.
